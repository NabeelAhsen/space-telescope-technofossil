    body: `A space telescope allows us to peek at the cosmos in a way human eyes cannot. Light that reaches Earth from space in the form of electromagnetic waves is mostly blocked out or interfered with by our atmosphere. To truly observe the night skies, scientists have extended their eyes beyond Earth's atmosphere. Launching a Space telescope into orbit is one of the ways in which we accomplish this. There are a number of telescopes in space right now, and a number more scheduled to launch in the future. Traditional ground telescopes use large pieces of refractive lenses made of glass to focus light into a particular focal point, where distant images became clear. The problem with these lenses is that in order to focus on distances extremely far away, lenses required thicker and heavier glass cut to unreasonable diameters. Modern telescopes use the power of curved mirrors to accomplish the same task in a feasible way. Famous telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope use spectrometers to isolate individual electromagnetic wave frequencies. They are able to see the universe in a wider spectrum than is visible to us.`,

      body: `With the twentieth century came scientists, educators, astronomers, and physicists. Some of the earliest astronomical literature spoke about the wonders of the reflective mirror for use within telescopes. Dr. Edward Arthur Fath was one such astronomer and communicator, who published a piece in the Scientific American in 1913 comparing reflective mirror telescopes over refractive-lensed telescopes (Fath 1913). Fath discussed the overall long-term cost benefit of using reflective telescopes and argued that they are more efficient, adaptable, and maintainable than their traditional counterparts. This notion stuck with astronomers over the next few decades. In the 30's, Dr.John Strong created a new method of coating various metals onto curved mirrors in the California Institute of Technology. One of these metals that seemed to reflect particularly well was aluminum. In 1934, fellow Caltech astronomer Edison Petit developed Strong's methods to compare the reflective power of mirrors coated with silver versus mirrors coated with aluminum. He published his results in the Publication of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in the same year and concluded that aluminum performs better in nearly every category as compared to silver. He argued that while aluminum does not reflect certain colors as completely as silver does, it outperforms in other indices across a wide spectrum of electromagnetic waves (Pettit 1934, pp. 31). I believe this marked a shift toward a cheaper, better way of producing telescopes. This coincidentally came at a time where the production of aluminum was booming rapidly across the globe.`,
