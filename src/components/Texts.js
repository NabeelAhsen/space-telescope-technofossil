    body: `A space telescope allows us to peek at the cosmos in a way human eyes cannot. Light that reaches Earth from space in the form of electromagnetic waves is mostly blocked out or interfered with by our atmosphere. To truly observe the night skies, scientists have extended their eyes beyond Earth's atmosphere. Launching a Space telescope into orbit is one of the ways in which we accomplish this. There are a number of telescopes in space right now, and a number more scheduled to launch in the future. Traditional ground telescopes use large pieces of refractive lenses made of glass to focus light into a particular focal point, where distant images became clear. The problem with these lenses is that in order to focus on distances extremely far away, lenses required thicker and heavier glass cut to unreasonable diameters. Modern telescopes use the power of curved mirrors to accomplish the same task in a feasible way. Famous telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope use spectrometers to isolate individual electromagnetic wave frequencies. They are able to see the universe in a wider spectrum than is visible to us.`,

      body: `With the twentieth century came scientists, educators, astronomers, and physicists. Some of the earliest astronomical literature spoke about the wonders of the reflective mirror for use within telescopes. Dr. Edward Arthur Fath was one such astronomer and communicator, who published a piece in the Scientific American in 1913 comparing reflective mirror telescopes over refractive-lensed telescopes (Fath 1913). Fath discussed the overall long-term cost benefit of using reflective telescopes and argued that they are more efficient, adaptable, and maintainable than their traditional counterparts. This notion stuck with astronomers over the next few decades. In the 30's, Dr.John Strong created a new method of coating various metals onto curved mirrors in the California Institute of Technology. One of these metals that seemed to reflect particularly well was aluminum. In 1934, fellow Caltech astronomer Edison Petit developed Strong's methods to compare the reflective power of mirrors coated with silver versus mirrors coated with aluminum. He published his results in the Publication of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in the same year and concluded that aluminum performs better in nearly every category as compared to silver. He argued that while aluminum does not reflect certain colors as completely as silver does, it outperforms in other indices across a wide spectrum of electromagnetic waves (Pettit 1934, pp. 31). I believe this marked a shift toward a cheaper, better way of producing telescopes. This coincidentally came at a time where the production of aluminum was booming rapidly across the globe.`,

      body: `Space telescopes are designed to be transportable, durable, and effect. Aluminum is used often and widely to coat the frames of satellites and space telescopes as thermal blankets. To produce aluminum, however, a steady supply of bauxite rock is needed. At the turn of the nineteenth century, the United States and France were the only large known distributors of bauxite. By the 1930s, however, there were mines being dug across South America, Southeast Asia, and part of Southern Europe (Gendron et. al 2013, pp.24). By the 1940s, bauxite was being mined and distributed from six continents. This increased production and demand for aluminum is often attributed to the civiian and military uses of aluminum in the early twentieth century. In "Aluminum Ore", Robin Gendron et. al. argue that this dramatic increase in demand is the result of worldwide global value chains that were initially created by government agencies, but were followed through via local business. Gendron suggests that the creation of such global value chains following the First World War was a direct result of the efforts of both governments and businesses. Currently, Australia and China are among the top bauxite producers in the world, producing roughly 68,000 and 44,000 million tons per year respectively (pp. 8). Gendron also points out that these value chains were naturally a result of a surge in demand for "fire-power and transportation, and the advent of military aviation" (pp. 9).`,

    body: `The Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts were constructed identical to each other. They were launched in 1977 from Cape Carnaveral, Florida with the primary mission of studying Saturn and Jupiter. The telescopes mounted to these space crafts were not meant to orbit Earth; they were meant to head to the stars. They discovered active volcanoes on the moons of Jupiter and studied the rings of Saturn in great detail. Completing their primary mission successfully, the voyager spacecrafts then continued on to their secondary mission, the Voyager Interstellar Mission. The imagined future of these spacecrafts was not to be decommissioned or retired, but to act as "messages in bottles" through interstellar space. It was well intended that their space telescopes will not return to Earth to be fossilized in any manner. They were intended to be testaments to human culture that extended beyond our solar system. Nick Sagan, the son of Astronomer Carl Sagan who was responsible for the Voyager missions, reflects on their success: "the Voyager milestone is not just a thought exercise - it's an actual, physical accomplishment on behalf of all humanity" (Showstack 2013, pp. 351).`,

      body: `The goal of a space telescope is to serve a long and useful life collecting as much information as it can. Its retirement is a welcome one at the end of its lifespan, but it's rare for a successful space telescope to embed itself as a technofossil in the Earth. Space telescopes are often retired while in orbit. To do this, ground crew discontinues any communications with that telescope and allows it to continue its orbit or trajectory it was on. This eventuality is met with satisfaction by some astronomers, and frustration by others. Decommissioned satellites and space telescope equipment can often be found among the "breakup debris" that orbits earth. Shenyan Chen discussed the phenomena of increasing space debris that is acumulating in Earth's orbital atmosphere in her publication "The Space Debris Problem" (Chen, 2020). Chen argues that such a sudden increase in space debris is making it hard for organizations like the International Space Traffic Management Organization (ISMO) to catalogue and keep track of every piece of junk. According to Chen and NASA, knowing the location of each junk is an important way to make decisions regarding space telescope launches and maintenance procedures. However, international cataloguing efforts also have given rise to efforts like the Active Debris Removal (ADR) initiatives.`,

      body: `Novelist Thomas Mallon wrote in his 2011 essay "The Night Shift" that the Voyager missions "[carry] with [them] more of human personality and culture ... than any of the manned spacecraft that went to the moon" (Mallon 2011, pp. 169). He was referring to the Golden Records, 12-inch phonograph records that were aboard Voyager 1 and 2. These records were gold-plated copper disks that embedded within them the diversity of life on and culture on Earth. The etchings on the cover of this record are instructions for how it is meant to be used. The top left corner depicts an image of the record itself along with instructions on how to use the stylus it carries. The asterisk-like figure below it shows Earth's relative position to 14 pulsar stars. The intention is to draw a map back to us should this record ever be found. The remaining markers communicate the sciences we know, starting with the fundamental diagram of the Hydrogen atom in the bottom right. Hydrogen is the most abundant atom in the universe, and the designers of this record believed that it should be universally recognized by life-like-us. The instructions taken together decode the mathematics we use, the physics we understand, and ultimately show how to decode the binary signals that are encoded within the record. Once decoded, viewers are able decipher images, of which the first is a circle, shown on the front of the record to let viewers know they are on the right track. These images show pictures of people, buildings, things, and of the Earth. Encoded parallel to them are audio waves that host a collection of music and sounds of Earth. These include the sounds of surf, wind, thunder, and greetings in 55 languages.`,
